				Its one of those things which really grates on me as a DM. 'So, you studied and learned intensely at all these disparate things, but all this stayed nicely siloed and didn't make you any smarter as a whole? Its not like your a robot running all these stand alone skill softs!'

</div>It's a Space Biosuit (UT179) with the Morphwear (and, likely, Rainbow) option (UT189). UT actually has plenty of flavorful stuff, but it can be appallingly hard to find.

			Well, her inability to deal credible damage is what doomed her . . . not that she couldn't have lost with force swords<br>
<br>
She goes all out to throw a pair of deceptive swings with a DWA . . . Vespers parry is insane, but her attack then is also fairly insane.  She has a couple chances at a 6 or less for a crit, then a couple chances he blows his parry.   <br>
<br>
If she lands a blow, Tane goes right to death check land with 8d+16 wallop from a Force Sword.   So he is looking at a death check, KO check, and stun/knockdown check to continuerumbling, which he might be unlucky enough to fail one of<br>
<br>
The +8 is of course huge beyond reckoning, since the +8 ST means even 2 hits of a force sword won't yield 6x HP wallop, and +8 HT means he won't fail HT checks, and you already pointed out the parry awesome<br>
<br>
However with a force sword level damage she goes from 'roadkill' to 'underdog'<br>
<br>
I don't think a 4k vibroblade is necessarily that much cheaper than a 10k force sword . . . . I mean, M'elena could easily buy a pair of force swords with her remaining budget
